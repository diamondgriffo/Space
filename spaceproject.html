		<p>Is it a hoax?</p>
		<p>Moon landing conspiracy theories. Astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong in NASA's training mockup of the Moon and lander module. Conspiracy theorists say that the films of the missions were made using sets similar to this training mockup</p>

		<p>There is cleraly the letter C on the rock.</p>
		<p>One of the conspiracy theories says that N.A.S.A would have labelled the rocks to know where to put them. Like any person would do.</p>
		<p>What do you think?</p>
		<p>This conspiracy theorie is a bit goofy, but i will put it in for the fun of it!</p>
		<p>Some small magazine brand said a few years later that they had figured it out!</p>
		<p>They said that they got in touch with a former N.A.S.A employee and he said:</p>
		<p>That on the day they were taken over by Aliens!</p>
		<p>But they had no evidence at all!</p>

		<p>It's either their crazy or there's another secret N.A.S.A are hiding from us!</p>

		<p>Mercury's temperatures can go between -279 Fahrenheit (-173 Celsius) at night to 801 Fahrenheit (427 Celsius) during the day.</p>
		<p><mark>This is hot enough to melt lead!</mark></p>
		<p>It takes 88 earth days to orbit the sun</p>
		<p><strong>Venus</strong></p>
		<p>Venus is the second closest planet to the sun</p>
		<p>Its highest tempeture ever recorded  is around 872 Fahrenheit, 467 Celsius</p>
		<p><mark>Almost Hot enough to melt a whole spoon</mark></p>
		<p>It takes 243 days to orbit the sun</p>

		<p><strong>Earth</strong></p>
		<p><mark>Our Planet!!!!!!</mark></p>
		<p>Earth is 97% Salt Water</p>
		<p>Only 3% is land </p>
